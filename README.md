# LinearEffectManager-2
 
Hi there! Linear Effects Manager 2 is a iteration of my first project: Linear Event Manager (right... i forgot i changed the naming of the files from Event to Effect)

This project is purely written in C# and is more compact, efficient and customizeable than the first version!

You can import this file as a template for a Unity project or switch to the "package" branch to have the plucked out files of the tool!

# LinearEffectManager-2
 
Hi there! Linear Effects Manager 2 is a iteration of my first project: Linear Event Manager (right... i forgot i changed the naming of the files from Event to Effect)

This project is purely written in C# and is more compact, efficient and customizeable than the first version!

You can import the folder "PackageOnly" for just the Demo and node editor scripts or go to the main branch and get the Unity project folder template!

# LinearEventManager-2
 
Hi there! Linear Effects Manager 2 is a iteration of my first project: Linear Event Manager (right... i forgot i changed the naming of the files from Event to Effect)

This project is purely written in C# and is more compact, efficient and customizeable than the first version!

For now, the this is all im writing for the readme

You can import this files as a template for a Unity project or you can pluck out the following files and add them into your own Unity projects:
1) LEM2_Scripts (Add into Unity Asset folder)
2) LEM2_EditorFiles (Add this into a pre-existing "Editor" folder inside the Asset folder)
3) Demo folder (You can add it if you want to have examples to work with)
